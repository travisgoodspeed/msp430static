\section{mspgcc}

This is the only compiler for which complete support is available,
and it is the primary target of the framework.  {\tt msp430-objdump}
can dump libraries with symbol information, and libraries are grabbed
by {\tt .lib.import.gnu} from {\tt /usr/local/msp430}.

\section{IAR}

\todo{Import script pending.}

{\tt /opt/iar/common/bin/xlink.exe} can be used to dump a library with symbol information.
Libraries are stored in {\tt /opt/iar/430/lib/}.  Be sure to call the
executables through wine.

\section{Code Composer}

\todo{Import script pending.}

{\tt /opt/cc430/bin/dis430.exe} can be used to dump the libraries.
Libraries are stored in {\tt /opt/cc430/lib}.

\section{Crossworks}

\todo{Import script pending.}

{\tt /opt/cw430/bin/hex} can be used to dump the libraries.
Libraries are stored in {\tt /opt/cw430/lib}.

\section{ImageCraft}

\todo{Import script pending.}

Libraries exist in {\tt /opt/iccv7430/lib}.  Libraries are in an ASCII format
similar to that use by AS430.  {\tt libc.a} ought to be simple enough to parse
by Perl.
