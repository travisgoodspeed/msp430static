Howdy y'all,

This is an Perl tool that I wrote a decade ago for reverse engineering
MSP430 firmware in a SQL Lite database.

A lot has changed in ten years, and you shouldn't use this tool.  Use
IDA Pro, Binary Ninja, Ghidra, or Radare2 instead, as they all support
this MSP430 far better than this hastily written tool ever could.
